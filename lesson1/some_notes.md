A **compiler** is a program (or collection of programs) that reads source code (typically written in a high-level language) and translates it into some other language (typically a low-level language, such as assembly or machine language, etcâ€¦).
<br> An **interpreter** is a program that directly executes the instructions in the source code without requiring them to be compiled into an executable first.
